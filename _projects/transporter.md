We built a safe driving system that helps drivers recognize obstacles in advance.

This platform consists of dual sensors (camera and LiDAR) for consistent object detection and safety warnings.

In this project, I was responsible for LiDAR mapping, localization, and camera object detection.

In addition, we created the virtual environment of shipyard for the realistic testing of our method.

To generate the environment, we not only referred the geometric information, but also 3D information from the map created by the LiDAR.
