We researched a pose estimation algorithm that tracks the pose of a painting robot in the shipyard.

To conduct the research, we collected data at the shipyard and tested our algorithm using this data.

Furthermore, we made the algorithm executable as an 'exe' program in the Windows environment for general use by workers in the shipyard.

In this project, I was responsible for IMU-based pose estimation and project management.
